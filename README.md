### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Natalie. I'm a software engineer at CoverMyMeds, where I build software to help people get the medicine they need to live healthier lives. I work with Rails and React, and always excited to learn something new.
Prior to becoming an engineer, I used to organize droidcon Android developer conferences in NYC & SF.
