### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Natalie. I'm a full stack engineer at Project Ronin, where I build software to develop an end-to-end cancer care platform that helps doctors and patients make better-informed decisions about treatment - https://www.projectronin.com/

I work with Rails, Javascript and Kotlin, and always excited to learn something new.
Prior to becoming an engineer, I used to organize droidcon Android developer conferences in NYC & SF.
